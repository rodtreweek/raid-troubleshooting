# raid-troubleshoting

Since this has come up, and I can't remember how to even install the megacli utility - let alone all the cryptic commands I may need to run, this seems like as good a spot as any to dump some info.


The same install file is used on all flavors of Linux/BSD, etc. and is currently available here: https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search?dk=megacli (most current version as of 11/20/17: 8.07.14-1) or in a pinch, earlier versions (as of now) appear to be available from here: http://download2.boulder.ibm.com/sar/CMA/XSA/ibm_utl_sraidmr_megacli-{{ megacli_version }}_linux_32-64.zip.
